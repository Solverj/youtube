# My why through coaching by Simon Sineks's coach, Jerry Thompson III:

1. Me: To acquire knowledge such that I can bring the future to me.  
2. Plural: To acquire knowledge such that we can bring the future to us.  

## How to get there  
  
1. Knowing my essence, what I believe in. (Passion)
2. Humility, to have the perspetive that my first impression should be ignored, and people have
valuable information and I should listen to them and ask what it is, in what they say, they love so much. (Getting their essence) (experience) 
3. Creative problem solving, to be able to solve the problems that other's don't want to solve. (Great at work) 
4. Complex challenges, to be able to return to divide and conque for any challenge that may seem  
too daunting.
5. Pursuit and investigate knowledge. If I've seen a problem and can describe it, I can solve it. (Great at work)  1. Ask ChatGPT to explain it
 2. Lookup wikipedia to define it  
 3. Lookup youtube for concrete examples
 4. Play around with the smallest problems in the domain  
6. Sharing of knowledge. Knowledge is not mine, it should be shared, re-defined and not be something to be proud of, because pride is a barrier to re-visit our own knowledge-gaps and faults.
 1. Anchoring bias (Janes Clear) 
 2. Confirmation bias (James Clear) 
 3. Dunning-Kruger effect (limited competence yields overconfidence)

## What I want with youtube.
### To teach other's what I wished someone would have taught me  
1. To teach developers, especially java/kotlin developers, that they need to learn another language to stay relevant. I'll do this with the Go programming language. The reason is that startup-time, going back to why I feel 1337 because I'm analytical and feel I want to do what's pragmatically most sound doesn't resonate with JVM anylonger. JVM isn't relevant due to cloud computing, cost-per transaction, cold reboots (functions, lambda), isn't cost-effective (loading the whole JVM into a container). (experience)   
2. To become better, incrementally, by taking more controll over ones environment. If you want to change a habit, change the environment first. I.e., Don't buy candy and store it in the house if you want to avoid eating unhealthy options when the evening strikes and you want to relax on the couch. The same applies to coding and all aspects of life. So I'd like to show the world the power of neovim with it's LSP's, autocompletion, shortcuts and how to, with some hard work, create an environemnt where you more easily stay in the "zen-mode", i.e., where you code for hours and feel you've accomplished a lot. (The chimp paradox) 
3. To become better by using the terminal more, such that you use the mouse less. The mouse if like using the harddrive, instead of using something like the RAM or even better, the CPU cache. 
4. Such that you feel more proud of yourself, because you have better control over your computer, your habits and that you've made a lot of decisions for your self. 
5. To teach how to think, in must have's and not nice to haves. (Pragmatic programmer)
6. To teach how to understand people better, and yourself, by framing your questions in a curious fashion such that other's want to answer, i.e., ask how and what, not why. Why is emotional even if you don't think it. (Negotiate as if your life depends on it)
7. To mirror people on what they say, don't try to be the smartest person in the room, but try to be the dumbest. (Negotiate as if your life depends on it, and Simon Sinek)  
8. How to say no. (Experience) 
9. How to delegate.  (Diary of a CEO)
10. How to build upton your strengths, and not focus on what you don't like doing (Diary of a CEO)
11. Give away your passion, don't keep it to yourself (Coco Chanels story)
12. How to focus on other's people's logical mistakes and the problem and not the person, i.e., code reviewing. Don't look at spelling mistakes, look at logical correctness (Primagen)
